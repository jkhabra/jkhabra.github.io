Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a
computer how to perform a task. Computers are very smart yet dumb at a same
time, i mean by this is if you don't tell computer to what to do ( don't give any
instructions) than it do nothing. Programming helps us to communicate with
computer and for that there are many programming languages. As i said computer
are smart they know how to do but has no idea what to do.

Giving instructions to computer to get what we want, sound easy enough and in a
way it is. For that we use programming languages like *javaScript*, *python* and
many more. In this blog post i am focusing on how to think or how to solve
problem. When we see a problem than we analyze and make a strategy to solve the
problem. It could work at first (rarely) or in few attempt in normal approach but it
carry many dependencies (variables) with it. If any change occurs in the dependencies,
than it could effect our desire result. But we can address these issues if we
approach the problem with mathematically thinking.


## What is the point of Mathematically
Although mathematics inspired programming languages are more preferable to many
people because they will find it easier to understand the syntax than
mathematical notation. Mathematics teaches the usage of algorithms, which helps
to develop logical thinking. It teaches what is *analytical* thinking, it is the way of breaking
down problems from unknown to known, can be quickly achieved through mathematics.

Algorithms are often used in mathematics.The algorithm is the basic technique
used to get the job done or a formula for solving a problem, based on conducting
a sequence of specified actions. If we solve problem math than it bends your mind to think
critically and analytically at the same time and this helps in developing your
brain to think logically.

If you solve a problem by breaking it down to smallest pieces than u already
uses the *Analytical* thinking technique. Analytical thinking is studying a
particular problem to develop more ideas about it or find a solution by breaking
it down to the smallest pieces. It can help us to investigate problems and find solutions to them.
