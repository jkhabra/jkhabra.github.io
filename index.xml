Our team is small, and we didn&amp;rsquo;t want to waste any time building anything that wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to be useful or helpful.
That&amp;rsquo;s why we decided to create Cli and a boilerplate: it would allow us to setup the basic structure of our app in one step so that we could get right down to work.</description></item><item><title>When to use a Class Component over a Function Component in React?</title><link>/blog/when-to-use-class-based-component/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/when-to-use-class-based-component/</guid><description>In React 16.8 with the addition of Hooks, you could use state , lifecycle methods and other features that were only available in class component right in your function component but functional component still can not handle react error boundary.

Computers are very smart yet dumb at a same time, i mean by this is if you don&amp;rsquo;t tell computer to what to do ( don&amp;rsquo;t give any instructions) than it do nothing. Programming helps us to communicate with computer and for that there are many programming languages. As i said computer are smart they know how to do but has no idea what to do.</description></item><item><title>How I utilize Github actions to automate my personal site</title><link>/blog/utilize-github-actions/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/utilize-github-actions/</guid><description>I have created this site in Hugo. The purpose of this site to showcase my work, skills and share my thoughts. Hugo is one of the most popular open-source static site generators. I chose hugo because there is big range of free Hugo themes available. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to invest too much in creating the theme myself. I chose osprey theme written by tomanistor, which I found very pleasing.
Using hugo is easy enough, but I wanted a completely effort-less development environment like we have in SoS app.</description></item><item><title>I'm Jatinder Khabra</title><link>/about/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Aug 2020 12:36:41 -0700</pubDate><guid>/about/</guid><description>A web developer in Mohail, Punjab. let languages = [&amp;#39;javascript&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;python&amp;#39;], frameworks = [&amp;#39;reactjs&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;nextjs&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;hapijs&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;flask&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;graphql&amp;#39;], tools = [&amp;#39;nodejs&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;postgres&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;mongo&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;hasura&amp;#39;], skillset = languages.concat(frameworks, tools) View my code on GitHub, connect with me on LinkedIn, follow me on Twitter, and check out my work below.</description></item><item><title>THE SOS APP</title><link>/portfolio/the-sos-app/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Aug 2020 15:58:10 +0530</pubDate><guid>/portfolio/the-sos-app/</guid><description>An open source project we are building for ourselves.
