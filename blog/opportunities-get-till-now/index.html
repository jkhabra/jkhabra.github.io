Our team is small, and we didn&rsquo;t want to waste any time building anything that wasn&rsquo;t going to be useful or helpful.</p><p>That&rsquo;s why we decided to create Cli and a boilerplate: it would allow us to setup the basic structure of our app in one step so that we could get right down to work. But it only sets up the basic structure; it doesn&rsquo;t include all the features we wanted. So then I got thinking: why not add those features?</p><p>We wanted a cli for fast development, but also wanted one that would provide us with the features we needed without having to reinvent the wheel each time. So now we have Cli which provides us with everything from built-in authentication and user management through to common CRUD operations and more—all while being easy-to-use and with zero configuration overhead!</p><p>I&rsquo;ve been working on Cli for the past few months, and I realized that there are a lot of boilerplates out there. But most of them only setup the basic app structure, which means they take a lot of time to set up. So I decided to create Cli, a tiny command line interface (CLI) that will help you get your app up and running in no time.
Cli will streamline your development process with fast, attractive and responsive templates.</p><p>I created it because I was frustrated with how long it took to build a new app. When we started building our first app, we had no idea where to begin. There were so many resources and tutorials out there that were just confusing and overwhelming. That&rsquo;s why I decided to create Cli: it&rsquo;s a fast way for developers to get up and running with their apps without having to spend hours reading through documentation or learning how things work from scratch.</p><p>Cli has been used by over 1 million developers worldwide since it was released in 2017, so you know it works!</p><p>The idea of a boilerplate was to make development faster. But we wanted more than that. We wanted to be able to build an app, and then add new parts as needed.</p><p>With SOS App, we&rsquo;ve found that it&rsquo;s possible to do this with a cli. You can basically just run SOS boilerplate and it&rsquo;ll automatically build your app for you. You can also update files or add new ones in one file. So if you want to add something like a new route, or change how you handle a template file, all in one place—you can do it!</p><p>We&rsquo;ve also found that we&rsquo;re able to use SOS App&rsquo;s boilerplate for both small projects and large ones—it&rsquo;s just so easy and fast! And it makes me happier knowing that my code is going somewhere I know will be safe and secure.</p></article><div class=pagination><a href=/blog/when-to-use-class-based-component/>&#171; When to use a Class Component over a Function Component in React?</a></div></section><br><section class=disqus><div id=disqus_thread></div><script type=text/javascript>(function(){if(window.location.hostname=="localhost")
