The purpose of this site to showcase my work, skills and share my thoughts. Hugo is one of the most popular open-source static site generators. I chose hugo because there is big range of free Hugo themes available. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to invest too much in creating the theme myself. I chose osprey theme written by tomanistor, which I found very pleasing.
Using hugo is easy enough, but I wanted a completely effort-less development environment like we have in SoS app.</description></item></channel></rss>
